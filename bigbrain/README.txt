A repository for Big Brain meta-data

This repository currently contains:
  Intensity profiles (s x parcels, where s represents a equivolumetric surface) 
  Statistical moments (m x parcels, where m represents the moments: mean, std, skewness and kurtosis)

The profiles were generated by sampling Big Brain intensities along equivolumetric surfaces at 163,842 matched vertices per hemisphere.
Six equivolumetric surfaces were built between layer 1 and layer 4, and layer 4 and white matter. Thus the eighth surface is layer 4.
