A repository for Big Brain meta-data

This repository currently contains:
  Intensity profiles (parcels X s, where s represents a equivolumetric surface) 
  Statistical moments (parcels x m, where m represents the moments: mean, std, skewness and kurtosis)

The profiles were generated by sampling Big Brain intensities along equivolumetric surfaces at 163,842 matched vertices per hemisphere.
Six equivolumetric surfaces were built between layer 1 and layer 4, and layer 4 and white matter. Thus the eighth surface is layer 4. 
Profiles and moments are available with and without regression for the midsurface y-coordinate. The BigBrain exhibits a strong anterior-posterior gradient in intensity values that is likely partially due to the coronal slicing and reconstruction, and partly to do with variations in cortical architectural.
