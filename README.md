# micaopen

Open Software from the MICALAB and other useful tools and supplementary data. 

MPC: tool for microstructure profile covariance analysis, which can generate subject specific networks from histological reconstructions as well as myelin sensitive MRI data. For further details, see our paper: Paquola et al. 2019 PLoS Biology, link here" https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000284

diffusion_map_embedding: this code implements diffusion map embedding technique in Matlab, used in our hippocampal subfield connectivity gradient paper: Vos de Wael et al., 2018 PNAS, link here: https://www.pnas.org/content/115/40/10154.abstract. These tools have now become part of BrainSpace, see http://brainspace.readthedocs.io

SurfStat: Contains Keith Worsley's SurfStat (Chicago version) for surface- and volume-based statistical analysis and visualization. Requires matlab. Documentation links are here: http://math.mcgill.ca/~keith/surfstat or http://mica-mni.github.io/surfstat. Also contains addons from the micalab and tutorial data. 

BigBrain: BigBrain histological profiles and statistical profile moments. Please cite Paquola et al., (2019) when using the Big Brain profiles (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000284)

a_moment_of_change: This repository is a companion to our preprint "A Moment of Change: Shifts in myeloarchitecture characterise adolescent development of cortical gradients". In the repo, we provide preprocessed data used in the analysis as well as the script to reproduce the primary figures. 

mica_powertools - extra scripts from the MICA lab, loosely documented only but perhaps soon unified and toolboxed

autism_hierarchy - videos of step wise functional connectivity within a hierarchical framework (Hong et al., under review)

dcm_sorter - python code to sort a dicom directory into subfolders 

The  micaopen tools result from the dedication and collaboration of all members of the lab, notably Reinder Vos de Wael, Casey Paquola, Oualid Benkarim, Sara Lariviere, Seok-Jun Hong,
